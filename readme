This is Lawrence Project and here is some step he took when creating this project:
STEPS:

1) I Craeted  The indexs' first which comprises of the html, css and javaScript; and in the HTML i created many div containing the 
content of my website also creating some Js features that make it attractive asin the displaying name;

2)Then i created The Css and added it some Css properties; so that it it will look responsive (i mean @media features); and i added     some interactive color blending to make sure that the whole colors is highly blended together to give a good looking interface.

3)I also created a Js file which cancel and open the nav's when it is in small phones(i mean using little px);like  Iphone XR and samsung; the ClassToggle helped me to go in touch with the main principle that aid me to get the main thing am aiming for that is to create a responsive navbar

4)Secondly:
I craeted A responsive form properties that allows the User to input his/her name to loggin to the main website; although i only added the front-end properties without adding any backend features that can intermediate my two files; but at least  i achieved the front-end principles that i have been looking for.

Then Let Look into into my main file called lawrence.
Here I calmly went through many researches and finally created a mind-blowing freelancing page.This free-lancing page comprises of The main navbar that is highly responsive and also that can lead you to its paarticular content..Asin In when you are in the home page and you click on the contact me button which is at the end of the page; it will immediately take you to the contact section immediately; and also some interactive Js features . IThis is my First work that have made my crazy ..I seriously Laboured to make sure that it bring a good client interface to the client..Even though the client is too lazy to scroll down; he/she can toggle around the navbars to create an ease correspondance in the site..



Additionally:
I added The copyright features that shows that am the craetor of the site and also i used fliva logo as my logo because i did not have logo for now but i will have in the nearest future, that will now inspire me to make a good site that will serious help me; This project will be the backbone to work harder.
